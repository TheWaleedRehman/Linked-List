This Project consists of;

1. Insertion: 

insert_begin: A function that takes a data point d and adds the node with the data point at the beginning of the linked list. 

insert_end: A function that takes a data point d and adds the node with the data point at the end of the linked list. 

insert_at: A function that takes a data point d and a position p and adds the node with the data point at a specific position in the linked list.  

2. Deletion:  

delete_begin: A function that deletes the node at the beginning of the linked list. 

delete_end: A function that deletes the node at the end of the linked list. 

delete_at: A function that takes position p and deletes the node at a specific position in the linked list.  

delete_data: A function that takes a data point d, searches for the first instance of the data point and deletes that node (while keeping rest of the linked list connected). 

Traversal: A function that traverses (scans) and displays the elements of the linked list. 

Search: A function that takes a data point d and returns the pointer to the node containing the first instance of the data point. 

 

3. Additional Operations: 

Traversal: A fun Reverse action that takes the linked list and returns the reverse ordered linked list. 

Sort: A function that rearranges the linked list into ascending order of the data points, returns the head of the ordered linked list. 

Size Determination: A function that returns the number of the elements (nodes) in the linked list. 

 

4. Memory Management: 

    - Ensure proper memory allocation and deallocation (garbage collection) using `new` and `delete` for nodes.
